# This file defines the default soundalias files to load if no map specific loadspec file is found
# If you want to include sounds into your map file which are not included here you should make a seperate 
"# load spec file int the form of ""<map name>.csv"" using this file as a base.  You should only load the"
# soundalias files which are absolutely necessary to keep the sound memory footprint as small as possible
